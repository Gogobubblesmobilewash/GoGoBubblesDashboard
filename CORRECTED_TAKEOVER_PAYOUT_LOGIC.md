# ✅ Corrected Takeover Payout Logic for Lead Bubblers

## 💡 **Base Rules**

- **Lead Bubblers do NOT receive hourly pay during a full takeover** — they receive:
  - **Their share of the job payout**
  - **A flat bonus that scales with effort**
  - **Original Bubbler's share is deducted first** based on how much they completed
  - **Lead bonus increases** the more they take over

## 🧮 **Breakdown (Based on $45 Job for Simplicity)**

| Work Completed by Original Bubbler | Original Bubbler Gets | Lead Bubbler Gets (Base) | Takeover Bonus | 🧼 Final Payout to Lead | Notes |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------|------------------------|-------|
| **0% (No show / full takeover)** | $0 | $45 | $10 | **$55** | Lead does 100% — max bonus |
| **1% – 29%** | $10 | $35 | $7 | **$42** | ~70–99% completed by lead |
| **30% – 49%** | $20 | $25 | $5 | **$30** | Lead finishes ~50–70% |
| **50% – 50% (Even split)** | $22.50 | $22.50 | $3 | **$25.50** | Optional bonus for goodwill |
| **51% – 99%** | $45 (full payout) | $0 | $0 | **$0** | This is not a full takeover |
| **100% completed by original** | $45 | $0 | $0 | **$0** | Standard completion |

## 📈 **Bonus Summary**

| % of Work Lead Bubbler Performs | Bonus Amount |
|--------------------------------|--------------|
| **100%** | $10 |
| **70–99%** | $7 |
| **50–69%** | $5 |
| **Exactly 50%** | $3 (optional) |

---

## 💰 **Why This Makes Sense**

- ✅ **More work = more money**
- ✅ **Protects margins:** even in max bonus scenarios, you're only paying $55 for a job you'd have paid a contractor $45 to do originally
- ✅ **Encourages Leads to help** while not disincentivizing quality checks
- ✅ **Bonuses are flat,** easy to implement in dashboard logic
- ✅ **Lead Bubblers can view their projected payout** instantly

## 🧪 **Test on a Bigger Job**

Let's try it on a **$90 job** (e.g., 2BR/2BA Signature Deep Clean):

| Scenario | Original Bubbler Pay | Lead Base | Bonus | Lead Final | Company Cost |
|----------|---------------------|-----------|-------|------------|--------------|
| **Full takeover (0% done)** | $0 | $90 | $15 | **$105** | $105 |
| **Partial (20% done)** | $18 | $72 | $10 | **$82** | $100 |
| **Partial (40% done)** | $36 | $54 | $7 | **$61** | $97 |
| **Even split (50/50)** | $45 | $45 | $5 | **$50** | $95 |

Still leaves your profit room (especially since these are exception-based jobs), and keeps Leads happy.

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Function: `calculate_takeover_payout()`**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_takeover_payout(
    order_id UUID,
    original_bubbler_id UUID,
    lead_bubbler_id UUID,
    completion_percentage DECIMAL(5,2),
    takeover_type VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'partial'
)
RETURNS TABLE(
    original_bubbler_payout DECIMAL(6,2),
    lead_bubbler_base_payout DECIMAL(6,2),
    lead_bubbler_bonus DECIMAL(6,2),
    lead_bubbler_final_payout DECIMAL(6,2),
    total_company_cost DECIMAL(6,2),
    bonus_tier VARCHAR(50),
    calculation_notes TEXT
) AS $$
```

### **Bonus Scaling Logic:**

#### **For Jobs ≤ $50:**
- **100% Lead Work:** $10 bonus
- **70-99% Lead Work:** $7 bonus  
- **50-70% Lead Work:** $5 bonus
- **50/50 Split:** $3 bonus

#### **For Jobs $51-75:**
- **100% Lead Work:** $12 bonus
- **70-99% Lead Work:** $9 bonus
- **50-70% Lead Work:** $7 bonus
- **50/50 Split:** $4 bonus

#### **For Jobs > $75:**
- **100% Lead Work:** $15 bonus
- **70-99% Lead Work:** $10 bonus
- **50-70% Lead Work:** $8 bonus
- **50/50 Split:** $5 bonus

### **Completion Percentage Logic:**

#### **0% (Full Takeover):**
```sql
WHEN completion_percentage = 0 THEN
    original_payout := 0.00;
    lead_base_payout := job_total_amount;
    lead_bonus := CASE 
        WHEN job_total_amount <= 50 THEN 10.00
        WHEN job_total_amount <= 75 THEN 12.00
        ELSE 15.00
    END;
    bonus_tier_result := '100% Lead Work - Max Bonus';
```

#### **1-29% (High Partial):**
```sql
WHEN completion_percentage BETWEEN 1 AND 29 THEN
    original_payout := 10.00;
    lead_base_payout := job_total_amount - 10.00;
    lead_bonus := CASE 
        WHEN job_total_amount <= 50 THEN 7.00
        WHEN job_total_amount <= 75 THEN 9.00
        ELSE 10.00
    END;
    bonus_tier_result := '70-99% Lead Work - High Bonus';
```

#### **30-49% (Medium Partial):**
```sql
WHEN completion_percentage BETWEEN 30 AND 49 THEN
    original_payout := 20.00;
    lead_base_payout := job_total_amount - 20.00;
    lead_bonus := CASE 
        WHEN job_total_amount <= 50 THEN 5.00
        WHEN job_total_amount <= 75 THEN 7.00
        ELSE 8.00
    END;
    bonus_tier_result := '50-70% Lead Work - Medium Bonus';
```

#### **50% (Even Split):**
```sql
WHEN completion_percentage = 50 THEN
    original_payout := job_total_amount * 0.5;
    lead_base_payout := job_total_amount * 0.5;
    lead_bonus := CASE 
        WHEN job_total_amount <= 50 THEN 3.00
        WHEN job_total_amount <= 75 THEN 4.00
        ELSE 5.00
    END;
    bonus_tier_result := '50/50 Split - Optional Bonus';
```

#### **51-99% (Not Full Takeover):**
```sql
WHEN completion_percentage BETWEEN 51 AND 99 THEN
    original_payout := job_total_amount;
    lead_base_payout := 0.00;
    lead_bonus := 0.00;
    bonus_tier_result := 'Not Full Takeover - No Bonus';
```

#### **100% (Standard Completion):**
```sql
WHEN completion_percentage = 100 THEN
    original_payout := job_total_amount;
    lead_base_payout := 0.00;
    lead_bonus := 0.00;
    bonus_tier_result := 'Standard Completion - No Bonus';
```
