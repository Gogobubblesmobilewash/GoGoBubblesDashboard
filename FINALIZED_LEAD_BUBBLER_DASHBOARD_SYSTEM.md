# ✅ **FINALIZED LEAD BUBBLER DASHBOARD SYSTEM**
## Web-Based Oversight Mode with GPS Tracking & Claim Locking

---

## 🔐 **ELIGIBILITY TO BE A LEAD BUBBLER**

**All Lead Bubblers must be Elite:**
- ✅ **Certified in Fresh (Laundry)** + **either Shine (Car Wash) or Sparkle (Home Cleaning)**
- ✅ **Fresh Bubbler access is inherent in Elite status** — no need to list it separately
- ✅ **Must be scheduled for oversight mode** to access the bubbler dashboard

---

## 🧭 **CORE FUNCTIONALITIES**

### **1. Bubbler Visibility Filter**

**Leads will only see bubblers who:**
- ✅ **Are within a 45-mile dynamic radius**
- ✅ **Are flagged for check-in need** (new, low ratings, assistance requests, etc.)
- ✅ **Match the lead's qualified services** (Shine or Sparkle)
- ✅ **Have not already been claimed by another lead**

**✅ Priority tiers (color-coded)** will help organize who to assist first
**✅ Location dynamically updates** as lead moves
**❌ Bubblers outside range or not due for check-in** are not shown

---

### **2. Claim Locking Logic (First Come, First Served)**

**When a Lead selects a bubbler and presses "En Route":**
- ✅ **That bubbler is immediately locked to that lead**
- ✅ **They become invisible to other leads**
- ✅ **System logs the bubbler as "claimed"**
- ✅ **If another lead tries to select that bubbler during that time, they receive:**
  - ⚠️ **"This bubbler is already assigned to another lead."**

**After the check-in is completed:**
- ✅ **Bubbler becomes visible again** only if they are due for another check-in within the same day for a different reason (rare)
- ✅ **Otherwise, bubbler disappears** from the available list until the next cycle

---

### **3. Schedule Enforcement for Lead Mode**

**Leads must be assigned to oversight mode to access the bubbler dashboard**

**Oversight can be:**
- ✅ **Standalone** (e.g., "Lead Only – No Jobs Today")
- ✅ **Dual Role** (e.g., Morning job followed by afternoon oversight)

**Leads cannot enter oversight mode spontaneously**
**They must have been scheduled in advance**

---

### **4. GPS Tracking & Prompts (Web Dashboard)**

**Yes — GPS can be used via the web on both mobile and desktop browsers if permission is granted.**

**You can implement:**

#### **✅ GPS Functions for Bubblers & Leads**
**Used to determine:**
- ✅ **Accurate route status** (moving/not moving)
- ✅ **Arrival verification**
- ✅ **In-range validation** for check-ins
- ✅ **Drop-off location confirmation** (equipment, supplies, etc.)

#### **🔔 Prompt Examples:**

| Situation | Prompt |
|-----------|--------|
| **No movement 5+ minutes after "En Route"** | "We noticed you haven't moved. Are you still on your way?" |
| **10+ minutes idle at gas station** | "Looks like you're stopped. Please resume route or clock out." |
| **Outside 45-mile radius** | "You've moved outside your current oversight zone." |
| **Wrong address detected** | "GPS shows you're not at the job site. Please confirm arrival." |

## 💡 **ADDITIONAL SYSTEM SAFEGUARDS & ENHANCEMENTS**

### **⛽ Idle Status Control**

**If GPS shows no movement after a buffer grace period:**
- ✅ **System auto-pauses the clock**
- ✅ **Lead gets a warning**
- ✅ **Admin gets a flag notification for audit**

### **📋 Wrap-Up Notes Timing**

**After check-in:**
- ✅ **3–5 minute wrap-up window** is granted to submit notes
- ✅ **Once timer ends, lead must select next bubbler OR go idle**

### **📌 On-Call Equipment Delivery Flow**

**If a bubbler requests equipment, they:**
- ✅ **Are flagged 🔵 "Needs Equipment"**
- ✅ **Can be claimed by a nearby lead**
- ✅ **Lead gets check-in + delivery credit + GPS-verified drop-off time**
