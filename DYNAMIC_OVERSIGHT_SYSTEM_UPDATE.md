# 🔄 Dynamic Oversight System Update

## ✅ **Clarified Policy on Lead Bubbler Oversight Zones**

**Lead Bubblers are not bound by fixed geographic zones.**

Instead, they are evaluated based on the **specific Bubblers they directly oversee on a given day** — regardless of the neighborhood or distance — within a realistic **45-mile working radius**.

### **Key Principles:**
- ✅ **On each day**, a Lead Bubbler may check in on a different group of Bubblers depending on where jobs are concentrated
- ✅ **Quality scores and job outcomes** of those Bubblers they actually checked in on (via rating submissions and completion review) will impact that Lead's performance score
- ✅ **If a Lead checks in on 5 Bubblers on Monday and 3 different ones on Tuesday**, all 8 Bubblers' job reviews and issue logs for those days will count toward that Lead's accountability metrics
- ✅ **This model supports agile coverage**, promotes fairness, and prevents misuse of a fixed-zone system

## 🔄 **Updates Made to All Materials**

### **1. Cursor Dev File Update (`lead_takeover_logic.js`)**

**Replaced zone-based review tracking with bubbler-check-in group tracking:**

#### **New Functions Added:**
- ✅ **`trackLeadReviewScore()`** - Tracks performance based on actual check-ins
- ✅ **`calculatePerformanceScore()`** - Calculates 0-100 performance score
- ✅ **`getLeadOversightCoverage()`** - Gets dynamic coverage information

#### **Key Changes:**
```javascript
// OLD: Zone-based tracking
dashboard.trackLeadZoneRatingAverage(leadId, zoneId, timeFrame);

// NEW: Check-in based tracking
dashboard.trackLeadReviewScore({
  leadId,
  dateRange: 'week',
  bubblerIds: checkInLog.filter(entry => entry.leadId === leadId).map(e => e.bubblerId),
});
```

#### **Performance Metrics:**
- **Total Jobs Inspected** - Number of jobs the lead actually checked in on
- **Average Rating** - Aggregate customer ratings from inspected jobs
- **Takeover Rate** - Percentage of jobs requiring intervention
- **Quality Issues** - Number of customer complaints from inspected jobs
- **Performance Score** - 0-100 score based on multiple metrics
- **Check-in Coverage** - Statistics on bubblers overseen

### **2. SOP Copy Block Update (`LEAD_BUBBLER_SOP_POLICY.md`)**

**Added Performance Evaluation Section:**

#### **New Content:**
- ✅ **Lead Bubblers are assessed weekly** based on the specific Bubblers they checked in on during active shifts
- ✅ **Ratings are not calculated by static zones**. Instead, performance is based on rolling check-in coverage, regardless of which neighborhoods are visited
- ✅ **Daily check-in = scope of accountability** - only Bubblers you actually inspect count toward your performance metrics
- ✅ **Lead rating = rolling average** of those they inspect within a realistic 45-mile working radius
- ✅ **No locked zones** → agile coverage supports volume-based dispatching
- ✅ **Prevents overloading Leads** while ensuring accountability for actual oversight provided

### **3. Quick Reference Card Update (`LEAD_BUBBLER_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`)**

**Added Lead Review Zones Section:**

#### **New Content:**
- ✅ **❌ Not fixed by city or zip code**
- ✅ **✅ Based on actual check-ins**
- ✅ **Example:** Monday: Brittany, Ashley, Keith → Count toward your review
- ✅ **Tuesday:** Samantha, Jimmy → Count too
- ✅ **Weekly Score = All Bubblers you touched**
- ✅ **45-mile working radius** for coverage
- ✅ **Agile coverage** supports volume-based dispatching
- ✅ **No locked zones** → flexible oversight

## 📊 **Performance Calculation Logic**

### **Performance Score Formula (0-100):**
1. **Rating Score (0-50 points):** `averageRating * 10`
2. **Takeover Bonus (0-30 points):** `30 - (takeoverRate * 0.3)`
3. **Quality Penalty (0-20 points deducted):** `qualityIssues * 5`

### **Example Calculation:**
- **Average Rating:** 4.8 → 48 points
- **Takeover Rate:** 15% → 25.5 points (30 - 4.5)
- **Quality Issues:** 1 → -5 points
- **Final Score:** 68.5 → **69/100**
