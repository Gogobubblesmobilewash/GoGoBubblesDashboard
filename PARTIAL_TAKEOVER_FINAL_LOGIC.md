# ‚úÖ GoGoBubbles: Partial Takeover Final Logic (Confirmed SOP Language)

## üí∏ **Payout Responsibility**

- **Partial Takeover bonuses are NOT paid by the company**
- **They are deducted directly from the original bubbler's payout** (the one who fell behind or submitted sloppy work)
- **Lead Bubblers are already paid hourly by the company** - this bonus is additional and triggered only by true underperformance from a bubbler

---

## üü° **What Triggers a Partial Takeover? (Two Paths)**

A partial takeover can be triggered in **only two ways**:

### **1. Job Progress Delay (Performance Trigger)**
- If the lead bubbler is called in to assist because a job is **not on track for timely completion** (based on our estimated job duration), this is automatically classified as a partial takeover

**‚úÖ Example:** A Sparkle Bubbler is falling far behind on a 2 bed / 2 bath clean that should take ~2.5 hours solo. The Lead Bubbler must step in to mop, finish rooms, or handle appliances. **Triggered.**

### **2. Quality Check Fails (Correction Trigger)**
- If the Lead Bubbler is doing a standard quality check and discovers issues in completed rooms, and has to **physically re-do enough tasks**, this also qualifies as a partial takeover ‚Äî but only when certain effort thresholds are met (see below)

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è **Job Time Expectations (Estimates for Oversight Triggers)**

| Job Type | Example | Expected Solo Duration |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| **Sparkle Clean** | 1 bed / 1 bath | 1.5 hrs |
| **Sparkle Clean** | 2 bed / 1 bath | 2 hrs |
| **Sparkle Clean** | 2 bed / 2 bath | 2.5 hrs |
| **Signature Deep** | 2 bed / 2 bath | 3.5 ‚Äì 4 hrs |
| **Car Wash** | 1 vehicle, Signature Shine | 45‚Äì60 mins |
| **Laundry** | 1 Essentials Bag | 30‚Äì40 mins (folding + sorting) |

*These are used internally for performance oversight, not visible to customers.*

---

## üîß **Task Effort Classification**

Each re-clean or redo task is categorized as:

| Level | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Minor** | Quick, non-physical | Mirror streaks, single counter wipe-down, light touch-ups |
| **Moderate** | Light physical labor | Re-cleaning a toilet, re-mopping one small area, sweeping a room |
| **Major** | Time-intensive / heavier labor | Re-cleaning shower/tub, grout, fridge interior, dusting full ceiling fan, full floor mop |

---

## üîÅ **Thresholds for Automatic Partial Takeover Classification**

| Trigger | Partial Takeover? |
|---------|------------------|
| **3+ Minor tasks** | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **2+ Moderate tasks** | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **1+ Major task** | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **1‚Äì2 Minor tasks** | ‚ùå No |
| **1 Moderate + 1 Minor** | ‚ùå No |
| **2 Minor + 1 Moderate** | ‚úÖ Yes (Combo Threshold) |

**‚úÖ All qualifying takeovers require:**
- Before & after photo documentation
- Submission of "Partial Takeover" form
- Checkbox-style entry of what was redone (no long text)

---

## üì∏ **Documentation Requirements (Always Required)**

- **Photos before & after** of each re-done area
- **Lead Bubbler must use dashboard to:**
  - Tap which rooms/tasks were redone (checklist style)
  - Indicate coaching provided
  - Select reason for takeover: **Quality**, **Behind Schedule**, or **Both**

---

## ‚è≥ **Verification & Approval**

- **Partial Takeover bonus appears as "Pending"** on Lead Bubbler dashboard
- **Admin reviews photos + task list**
- **Once approved, bonus is added to next payout**
- **If denied, Lead Bubbler receives feedback + optional coaching**

## üéØ **Workflow Examples**

### **Example 1: Performance Delay Trigger**
1. **Scenario:** Sparkle Bubbler assigned to 2 bed / 2 bath clean (expected 2.5 hours)
2. **Issue:** After 2 hours, only 40% complete (should be 80% at this point)
3. **Lead Bubbler Action:** Steps in to mop floors and finish bathrooms
4. **Classification:** Performance delay trigger
5. **Result:** Partial takeover bonus deducted from original bubbler's payout

### **Example 2: Quality Fail Trigger**
1. **Scenario:** Lead Bubbler doing QA check on completed Sparkle clean
2. **Issues Found:** 
   - Mirror streaks (minor)
   - Toilet not properly cleaned (moderate)
   - Shower needs re-cleaning (major)
3. **Classification:** Quality fail trigger (1 major task = automatic partial takeover)
4. **Result:** Partial takeover bonus deducted from original bubbler's payout

### **Example 3: Combined Trigger**
1. **Scenario:** Lead Bubbler called in for assistance
2. **Issues Found:**
   - Job behind schedule (performance delay)
   - Multiple quality issues requiring rework (quality fail)
3. **Classification:** Combined trigger (both performance and quality issues)
4. **Result:** Partial takeover bonus deducted from original bubbler's payout
