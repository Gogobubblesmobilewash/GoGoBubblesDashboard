# 🧼 GoGoBubbles Lead Bubbler Role & Takeover Policy

## **Quality & Accountability**

### **Bonuses are only paid when thresholds are met**
- Leads should NOT intentionally prolong jobs for bonuses
- Focus on quality and efficiency, not bonus maximization
- Admin review required for all takeovers

### **Quality Matters**
- All customer reviews reflect on both Bubbler and Lead
- Assist when necessary, but prioritize oversight and coaching
- Maintain service standards while supporting team members

### **Rating Accountability**
- If a job receives a negative review after your check-in, your Lead rating may also be affected
- Quality oversight is part of your responsibility
- Customer satisfaction reflects on the entire team

### **Performance Evaluation**
- **Lead Bubblers are assessed weekly** based on the specific Bubblers they checked in on during active shifts
- **Ratings are not calculated by static zones**. Instead, performance is based on rolling check-in coverage, regardless of which neighborhoods are visited
- **Daily check-in = scope of accountability** - only Bubblers you actually inspect count toward your performance metrics
- **Lead rating = rolling average** of those they inspect within a realistic 45-mile working radius
- **No locked zones** → agile coverage supports volume-based dispatching
- **Prevents overloading Leads** while ensuring accountability for actual oversight provided

---

## **📊 Lead Bubbler Evaluation Metrics**

Lead Bubblers are evaluated on **two performance areas**:

### **A. Leadership Metrics (Coach & Oversight)**
- ✅ **Average rating from Bubblers overseen** (rolling 7–14 days)
- ✅ **Number of takeovers avoided via coaching**
- ✅ **Quality uplift:** Did job ratings improve after lead intervention?
- ✅ **Weekly job check-in count** (meets target)
- ✅ **Bubbler-to-Lead rating** (360° feedback from team members)

### **B. Personal Job Metrics (Own assignments)**
- ✅ **Maintain average rating ≥ 4.5** over last 10 personal jobs
- ✅ **Max 1 flagged customer complaint** per month
- ✅ **Timeliness:** 90% on-time start or earlier
- ✅ **Completion & follow-through:** No no-shows, ghosting, or "left early" flags

**🧠 Low personal scores can disqualify a Lead, even if oversight is strong.**

---

## **🚩 Warning Thresholds & Demotion Criteria**

Lead Bubblers can lose their role if metrics are repeatedly missed.

| Metric Missed | Strike System | Action |
|---------------|---------------|--------|
| Avg leadership score < 4.4 (2 weeks) | 1 Strike | Warning + Coaching |
| Avg personal job score < 4.3 (10 jobs) | 1 Strike | Internal Performance Review |
| 2+ flagged reviews in 30 days | Immediate | Temporary Suspension |
| Pattern of excessive full takeovers | 1 Strike | Role Review – Are they coaching or replacing? |
| Missed 3+ job check-ins in 2 weeks | 1 Strike | May lose weekly bonus eligibility |
| 2+ low Bubbler ratings (< 3 stars) in 30 days | 1 Strike | Admin review + Coaching/mediation |

**✅ 3 total strikes in any 45-day period = removal from Lead role** (can reapply after 30 days).

---

## **🔄 Bubbler-to-Lead Rating (360° Feedback)**

### **Two-way Accountability:**
Lead Bubblers aren't just supervising — they're also being observed.

**Every Bubbler that receives a check-in or quality review will be prompted to rate their Lead Bubbler privately after the job:**

- ✅ **Was the Lead respectful and professional?**
- ✅ **Did the Lead offer useful feedback?**
- ✅ **Was the Lead fair in their evaluation?**
- ✅ **Did the Lead feel approachable and supportive?**

### **Rating Prompt (shown post-job):**
> **"How was your experience with today's Lead?"**
> (1–5 stars + optional comment)
> - ✅ Friendly and supportive
> - ✅ Gave helpful tips or feedback
> - ✅ Treated me with respect
> - ✅ Fair in their judgment

### **Purpose:**
- **Encourages respectful leadership**, not micromanagement
- **Prevents personality clashes**, ego power-trips, or favoritism
- **Helps surface Leads** who may be "technically strong" but poor communicators or team motivators

### **Impact of Poor Bubbler Ratings:**
- **If a Lead receives 2 or more ratings < 3 stars from Bubblers in 30 days:**
  - 🚨 **Admin review is triggered**
  - 🟡 **Coaching/mediation may be required**
  - ⚠️ **1 Strike added to their profile** if complaints are verified

---

## **Pattern Monitoring & Safeguards**

### **Time Tracking Buffer**
- System flags if Lead logs more than 3 consecutive jobs with exactly 30 minutes of "light assistance"
- Prevents pattern abuse (e.g., Leads always hovering at max allowed assistance time)
- Triggers admin review or dashboard alert

### **Tiered Lead Bonus Accelerator**
- If Lead avoids all takeovers and assigned Bubblers maintain 4.7+ stars across 10 jobs
- Bonus incentive: $10–$15
- Encourages non-invasive leadership and coaching instead of takeover

### **Customer Complaint Filter**
- If Lead did light assistance and customer still complains:
  - Triggers double review of Lead and Bubbler
  - Possible override of shared score logic
  - Prevents Leads from "touching" just enough to shift rating weight but not enough to fix issues

### **Flag Overlap**
- Dashboard flag if Lead does full takeover on same bubbler more than once in a week
- Helps spot training issues, poor pairings, or early burnout
- Enables proactive intervention and support

---

## **Documentation Requirements**

### **Light Assistance**
- Standard check-in documentation
- Brief notes on assistance provided
- No additional forms required

### **Partial Takeover**
