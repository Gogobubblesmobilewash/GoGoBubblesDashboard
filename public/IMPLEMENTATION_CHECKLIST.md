# Implementation Checklist - Bubbler Dashboard

## âœ… COMPLETED ITEMS

### 1. âœ… Update all bubbler-scoped queries to filter via current_bubbler_id() joins

- **Equipment Tab**: Filters by `assigned_bubbler_id` and `bubbler_id` for requests
- **Messages Tab**: Filters by `bubbler_id` for user-specific messages
- **Ratings Tab**: Uses inner join with `job_assignments.bubbler_id = currentBubblerId`

- **Lead Feedback Tab**: Role-based filtering with proper RLS policies

### 2. âœ… Implement Messages compose/inbox + mark-as-read

### 6. âœ… Use visible error components when RLS blocks a query
- **ErrorBoundary**: Comprehensive error handling with retry functionality
- **RLS Error Detection**: Specific handling for RLS policy violations
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear error messages with helpful hints
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Easy retry options for failed operations
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during operations

### 7. âœ… Centralized Configuration System
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration using env vars instead of hardcoded values
- **Config Files**: `src/lib/config.ts`, `supabase-browser.ts`, `supabase-server.ts`
- **Security**: Service role key only available server-side
