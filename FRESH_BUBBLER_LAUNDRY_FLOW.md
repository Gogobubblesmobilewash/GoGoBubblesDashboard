## 🔄 **FRESH BUBBLER FLOW: PICKUPS, JOB STARTS, AND DROPOFFS**

### **🛠 IMPLEMENTED: `manageFreshBubblerLaundryFlow()`**

#### **🧩 Scenario 1: Multiple Pickups in One Shift**

**Current System Behavior:**
- Job status starts as: **Assigned → In Transit → Picked Up**

**New Safeguard:**
- After the last pickup of the day, a **countdown begins (90 minutes)**
- ⏳ **Within 90 minutes**, at least one laundry job must begin (In Progress)
- If no job begins in time:
  - ⚠️ **System flag:** "Delayed Job Start"
  - 🔔 **Alert to Admin + Lead Bubbler** (optional)
  - 💬 **Bubbler receives notification:**
    - "Please begin laundering jobs. A delay beyond 90 minutes is not permitted after completing pickups."

#### **📦 Scenario 2: Scheduled Pickups + Deliveries Same Day**

**Allow Fresh Bubbler to:**
- ✅ **Start a pickup route**
- ✅ **Intersperse drop-offs** if locations and routing allow
- ✅ **Maintain control of schedule** as long as no delivery is late

**System Should Track:**
- ⏱️ **Time of pickup** for each job
- 📍 **Delivery window** for each return
- 🚨 **Triggers if return delivery** is not marked In Transit by delivery deadline

## 🚫 **LAUNDRY HOARDING PREVENTION**

### **🛠 IMPLEMENTED: `enforceLaundryWorkloadBalance()`**

| Behavior | System Rule | Result |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **>3 jobs marked Picked Up but none In Progress** | Trigger warning after 90 mins | Admin alert |
| **Bag picked up but unwashed after 4 hours** | Flag for potential hoarding | Score impact or admin contact |
| **Job in Picked Up >24 hours with no updates** | Auto-escalate | Admin/Lead Bubbler intervention |

### **📋 Prevention Logic:**
```javascript
const balanceCheck = enforceLaundryWorkloadBalance({
  bubblerId: "bubbler_123",
  currentAction: "pickup",
  timestamp: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
});
```
