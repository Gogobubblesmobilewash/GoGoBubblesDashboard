# 🏠 **ENVIRONMENTAL QA SYSTEM**
## Home-Based Fresh Bubbler Oversight Policy & Workflow

---

## 🧼 **CONTEXT**

Fresh Bubblers may choose to work from:
- ✅ **A local laundromat** (recommended)
- ✅ **Their home** (permitted, but must meet hygiene and safety standards)

When assigned to oversee a home-based Fresh Bubbler, the Lead Bubbler's checklist must expand to include environmental conditions in addition to laundry quality.

---

## ✅ **SECTION 1: ENVIRONMENTAL QA CHECKLIST (LEAD VIEW)**

### **🛠 IMPLEMENTED: `generateEnvironmentalQAChecklist()`**

Upon on-site check-in, Lead Bubbler must assess:

| Category | Requirement | Pass/Fail | Critical |
|----------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| **Odor** | No strong pet odors or tobacco smoke | ❌ Fail = Reassignment trigger | ❌ No |
| **Surface Cleanliness** | Area where laundry is being handled (folded/sorted) must be clean and wiped down | ❌ Fail = Reassignment trigger | ❌ No |
| **Pets** | No free-roaming pets near laundry | ❌ Fail = Reassignment trigger | ✅ **Yes** |
| **Pest Presence** | No visible insects (esp. roaches, ants, fleas) | ❌ Fail = Immediate halt | ✅ **Yes** |
| **Laundry Setup** | Dirty laundry must be separated from clean; folding area must be organized | ❌ Fail = Photo + strike review | ❌ No |
| **Home Laundry Machine** | Washer/dryer visibly clean, no lint overflow or standing water | ❌ Fail = Equipment reassessment | ❌ No |

### **📋 System Behavior:**
```javascript
const environmentalQA = generateEnvironmentalQAChecklist({
  bubblerId: "bubbler_123",
  jobId: "job_456",
  serviceType: "laundry",
  isHomeBased: true
});
```

### **✅ Each Field Includes:**
- **Required** evaluation
- **📸 Photo proof** if any fail is detected
- **🗒️ Notes** (auto-suggest tags + optional short text)
- **Critical flag** for immediate action triggers

---

## 🚨 **SECTION 2: ENVIRONMENTAL QA FAILURE HANDLING**

### **🛑 IMPLEMENTED: `handleEnvironmentalQAFailure()`**

#### **Trigger Conditions:**
If **2 or more categories fail** OR any of the following are detected:
- Active pest presence
- Free-roaming pets during handling
- Strong tobacco odor

#### **🛠 Lead Action Flow:**
1. **Trigger Immediate Job Removal** (button: "Fail — Unsafe Conditions")
2. **Photos auto-uploaded**
3. **Timer stops**
4. **Strike logged** on Fresh Bubbler profile
5. **Job reassigned** to laundromat-based backup Bubbler
6. **Admin notified** for environment flag review

#### **📲 System Response:**
```javascript
const failureHandling = handleEnvironmentalQAFailure({
  leadId: "lead_123",
  bubblerId: "bubbler_456",
  jobId: "job_789",
  evaluation: environmentalEvaluation,
  photos: ["photo1.jpg", "photo2.jpg"],
  failureReason: "Multiple environmental violations detected"
});
```

---

## 🔄 **SECTION 3: CONSEQUENCES FOR FAILED HOME-BASED QA**

### **📊 IMPLEMENTED: Progressive Consequence System**

| Incident | Result | System Action |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| **First Fail (2+ violations)** | Job removed, 1 strike, coaching required | Standard failure logging |
| **Second Fail** | Temporary suspension from working from home | Auto-switch to laundromat mode |
| **Third Fail** | Permanent revocation of home-based Fresh Bubbler status | Permanent restriction applied |

### **🧠 Progressive Consequences:**
```javascript
switch (failureCount) {
  case 1:
    consequences.message = 'First environmental QA failure. Job removed, 1 strike added, coaching required.';
    break;
  case 2:
    consequences.temporarySuspension = true;
    consequences.message = 'Second environmental QA failure. Temporary suspension from working from home.';
    break;
  case 3:
    consequences.permanentRevocation = true;
    consequences.message = 'Third environmental QA failure. Permanent revocation of home-based Fresh Bubbler status.';
    break;
}
```

---

## 📲 **SECTION 4: DASHBOARD BEHAVIOR**

### **🛠 IMPLEMENTED: `checkEnvironmentalQAMode()`**

#### **Auto-Trigger Logic:**
- If a Lead Bubbler checks in to a Fresh Bubbler marked as "Home-Based"
- **"Environmental QA Mode"** is auto-triggered
- **UI shifts** to include both Laundry QA and Environment QA
- **Final wrap-up** shows two summaries: 🧺 Laundry + 🏠 Environment

#### **📱 Mode Detection:**
```javascript
const qaMode = checkEnvironmentalQAMode({
  bubblerId: "bubbler_123",
  serviceType: "laundry",
  workLocation: "home" // 'home' or 'laundromat'
});
```

---

## 🧠 **SECTION 5: ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. 🏠 Home Environment Approval Process**

#### **✅ IMPLEMENTED: `submitHomeEnvironmentApproval()`**

**Before being assigned any home-based jobs, Fresh Bubbler must upload:**
- Photo of folding area
- Washer/dryer (if applicable)
- Declaration of no pests/smoking
- **Approval by admin**

#### **📋 Approval Workflow:**
```javascript
const approvalRequest = submitHomeEnvironmentApproval({
  bubblerId: "bubbler_123",
  foldingAreaPhoto: "folding_area.jpg",
  washerDryerPhoto: "washer_dryer.jpg",
  noPestsDeclaration: "declaration.pdf",
  petInformation: {
    hasPets: true,
    petLocation: "backyard",
    securedDuringLaundry: true
  },
  additionalNotes: "Pets secured in backyard during laundry operations"
});
```

### **2. 🔄 Auto-Switch to Laundromat Mode**

#### **✅ IMPLEMENTED: Post-Fail Behavior**
- After one fail, Fresh Bubbler's dashboard will only allow jobs marked "Laundromat"
- **Until cleared by admin** through review process
- **Automatic restriction** prevents further home-based assignments

### **3. 🐕 Pet Tagging System**

#### **✅ IMPLEMENTED: Pet Information Tracking**
- **Option during onboarding:** "Pet present in home? If yes, where is pet secured during active laundry handling?"
- **Lets the Lead know** what to expect in advance
- **Pre-check reminders** include pet-specific instructions

---

## 💡 **SECTION 6: OPTIONAL AUTOMATION IMPLEMENTED**

### **⏰ Pre-Check Reminders**

#### **✅ IMPLEMENTED: `sendPreCheckReminder()`**

**Function:** 1 hour before Lead arrives, Fresh Bubbler receives:
- **"Reminder: Secure pets, clean area, prepare environment"**
- **Automated scheduling** based on Lead arrival time
- **Customizable timing** (default: 60 minutes before)

```javascript
const reminder = sendPreCheckReminder({
  bubblerId: "bubbler_123",
  leadArrivalTime: "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z",
  reminderMinutes: 60
});
```

### **📊 Environment History Log**

#### **✅ IMPLEMENTED: `getEnvironmentalHistory()`**

**Display past environment check-in outcomes on bubbler profile:**
- **Total checks** performed
- **Pass/fail rates** over time
- **Failure patterns** for admin review
- **Trend analysis** for risk assessment

```javascript
const history = getEnvironmentalHistory({
  bubblerId: "bubbler_123",
  daysBack: 90
});
```

### **🛡️ Customer Protection Clause**

#### **✅ IMPLEMENTED: Automatic Customer Protection**
- If home-based job fails QA, job is **fully redone by another Bubbler**
- **Customer receives bonus credit** for inconvenience
- **Quality guarantee** maintained regardless of failure

---

## 🔒 **SECTION 7: RISK MITIGATION**

### **📊 Environmental QA Risk Matrix**

| Risk Level | Trigger | Action Required |
|------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Low Risk** | 1 non-critical failure | Photo documentation + coaching |
| **Medium Risk** | 2+ non-critical failures | Job removal + strike + reassignment |
| **High Risk** | Any critical failure (pets/pests) | Immediate halt + job removal + admin review |
| **Critical Risk** | Multiple critical failures | Permanent home-work revocation |

### **🛡️ Quality Assurance Measures:**

1. **✅ Photo Documentation** - All failures require visual proof
2. **✅ Auto-Suggest Tags** - Standardized failure categorization
3. **✅ Progressive Consequences** - Escalating penalties for repeat violations
4. **✅ Admin Oversight** - All failures reviewed by management
5. **✅ Customer Protection** - Automatic job redo for failed environments
