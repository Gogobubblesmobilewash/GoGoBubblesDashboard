# ‚úÖ Tiered Partial Takeover Bonus System

## üîÅ **Recalibrating the Partial Takeover Bonus**

### **üéØ Current Problem:**
- **$15 flat bonus** is 33% of a $45 job, even if Lead only completed 10‚Äì20% of the task
- **Too punitive** to original Bubbler ‚Äî especially if they did 80‚Äì90% of the work
- **Doesn't scale proportionally** to job size (e.g., $15 penalty is steep on $45 vs. fairer on $90)

### **‚úÖ Proposed Solution: Tiered Partial Bonus (Job Size Dependent)**

We tie the partial takeover bonus to the overall job payout amount, using a percentage cap to scale it fairly.

---

## üí° **New Rule: Tiered Partial Takeover Bonus**

**Partial takeover bonus = 15‚Äì20% of total job payout, capped at $12**

| Job Payout | Max Partial Bonus | Percentage | Notes |
|------------|------------------|------------|-------|
| **$45** | **$8** | 17.8% | Reasonable for small jobs |
| **$60** | **$9** | 15% | Scales fairly with Signature Clean tier |
| **$75** | **$11** | 14.7% | Makes sense for larger jobs |
| **$90+** | **$12 MAX** | 13.3% | Bonus capped to protect Bubbler margin |

---

## ‚úÖ **Why This Works**

- üéØ **Keeps the bonus proportional** to job size
- üí∞ **Still rewards Lead Bubblers fairly** (in addition to hourly)
- üõ°Ô∏è **Protects your brand** by incentivizing quality without over-penalizing
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Maintains positive morale** across both roles

## üß† **Bonus Logic for Implementation**

### **When a Lead Bubbler initiates a Partial Takeover, system will:**

1. **Calculate total job payout** from order
2. **Apply 15‚Äì20% of payout**, up to $12 max
3. **Deduct from original Bubbler's earnings**
4. **Add bonus as pending payout** to Lead (shown with timer countdown for job duration)
5. **Admin approval still required** for final payout

### **Technical Implementation:**

```sql
-- Calculate tiered partial takeover bonus
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_tiered_partial_bonus(
    job_total_amount DECIMAL(6,2)
)
RETURNS DECIMAL(6,2) AS $$
DECLARE
    calculated_bonus DECIMAL(6,2);
BEGIN
    -- Calculate bonus as 15-20% of job amount, capped at $12
    calculated_bonus := LEAST(job_total_amount * 0.18, 12.00);
    
    -- Ensure minimum bonus of $5 for very small jobs
    IF calculated_bonus < 5.00 THEN
        calculated_bonus := 5.00;
    END IF;
    
    RETURN calculated_bonus;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### **Bonus Calculation Examples:**

#### **$45 Job:**
- **Calculation:** $45 √ó 18% = $8.10
- **Capped at:** $8.10 (under $12 limit)
- **Final Bonus:** $8

#### **$60 Job:**
- **Calculation:** $60 √ó 18% = $10.80
- **Capped at:** $10.80 (under $12 limit)
- **Final Bonus:** $11

#### **$75 Job:**
- **Calculation:** $75 √ó 18% = $13.50
- **Capped at:** $12.00 (over $12 limit)
- **Final Bonus:** $12

#### **$90 Job:**
- **Calculation:** $90 √ó 18% = $16.20
- **Capped at:** $12.00 (over $12 limit)
- **Final Bonus:** $12

## ‚úÖ **SOP Wording (Finalized for Onboarding + Developer Hand-off)**

### **Partial Takeover Bonus Policy:**

When a Lead Bubbler performs a Partial Takeover, they will receive a partial takeover bonus, scaled to job size:

- **Bonus = 15‚Äì20% of the total job payout (max $12)**
- **Paid in addition to hourly pay**
- **Bonus is deducted from the original Bubbler's payout**
- **Partial takeovers are triggered in cases where the original Bubbler:**
  - Falls behind on task timeline
  - Leaves job early due to emergency
  - Marks tasks as complete but key areas fail quality check
- **Light assistance** (e.g. helping carry items, light surface touch-ups) does not qualify as a takeover
- **Partial Takeovers must be documented** via task checklist and submitted for admin approval
- **If approved, bonus is processed** and displayed on the Lead's earnings dashboard

## üéØ **Workflow Examples**

### **Example 1: $45 Sparkle Clean - Minor Partial Takeover**
1. **Scenario:** Original bubbler does 85%, Lead finishes 15% due to emergency
2. **Original Bubbler:** Gets $37 (85% of $45) - $8 bonus = **$29**
3. **Lead Bubbler:** Gets $8 (15% of $45) + $8 bonus = **$16**
4. **Company Cost:** $29 + $16 = **$45** (same as original)
5. **Fairness:** Original keeps most earnings, Lead compensated for emergency assistance

### **Example 2: $60 Signature Clean - Moderate Partial Takeover**
1. **Scenario:** Original bubbler does 70%, Lead finishes 30% due to quality issues
2. **Original Bubbler:** Gets $42 (70% of $60) - $11 bonus = **$31**
3. **Lead Bubbler:** Gets $18 (30% of $60) + $11 bonus = **$29**
4. **Company Cost:** $31 + $29 = **$60** (same as original)
5. **Fairness:** Original penalized for quality issues, Lead rewarded for intervention

### **Example 3: $90 Deep Clean - Major Partial Takeover**
1. **Scenario:** Original bubbler does 40%, Lead finishes 60% due to timeline issues
2. **Original Bubbler:** Gets $36 (40% of $90) - $12 bonus = **$24**
3. **Lead Bubbler:** Gets $54 (60% of $90) + $12 bonus = **$66**
4. **Company Cost:** $24 + $66 = **$90** (same as original)
5. **Fairness:** Original significantly penalized for timeline failure, Lead well-compensated
