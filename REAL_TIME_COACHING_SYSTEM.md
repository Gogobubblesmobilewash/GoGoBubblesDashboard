## üì∏ **1. Photo Policy (Before & After) ‚Äî Required When Errors Found**

### **Trigger:**
Photos are required **only if an error is found** during a quality check.

### **What Must Be Photographed:**
- ‚ùó **"Before" photo** of the error or missed task
- ‚úÖ **"After" photo** showing how the Lead Bubbler fixed it
- **Short note per image** like: *"Mirror had streaks ‚Äì cleaned with microfiber + vinegar tip"*

### **Photo Requirements by Scenario:**

| Scenario | Photos Required? | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| **No errors found** | ‚ùå No | Standard QA check |
| **One minor error in one room** | ‚úÖ Yes, but only 1 photo set | Document the issue and fix |
| **Multiple errors across 2+ separate areas** | ‚úÖ Yes for all affected areas | Comprehensive documentation |
| **Any time Lead Bubbler steps in to fix a task** | ‚úÖ Required, even if minor | Proof of intervention |

---

## üö® **2. Partial Takeover Threshold**

### **NOT a Partial Takeover:**
- One error in bathroom + one error in living room
- Two minor issues in just one room

### **‚úÖ IS a Partial Takeover when:**
- **2 or more moderate to significant errors** in two separate areas
- **Example:** 2 errors in bathroom + 2 in kitchen
- **Example:** 1 error in bedroom + 3 in living room (if it required effort to correct)

### **System Prompt:**
*"You've reported multiple issues across 2 rooms. Would you like to reclassify this as a Partial Takeover?"*

## üéØ **3. Coaching Responsibilities ‚Äî Lead + Admin Oversight**

### **üéØ Lead Bubbler Onsite Coaching**
- **Light coaching only** (Quick Tip format)
- **Example:** *"Next time, spray glass and wipe in 'S' pattern to avoid streaks"*
- **Should take no more than 2-5 mins per incident**
- **May include pulling Bubbler aside to demonstrate quickly**

### **üì© Admin-Follow-up Coaching (via email)**
**Admin receives:**
- Error summary
- Before/After photos
- Coachable topic (tagged)

**Admin sends coaching email within 24-48 hours:**
- Includes KB article link for that issue
- Notes what the Lead Bubbler observed
- Includes improvement tips and reminders

### **üß† Example Email:**
