## üîê Account Sharing Prevention System

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented to prevent unauthorized account sharing and ensure only authorized devices can access Bubbler accounts.

## üõ°Ô∏è Core Security Features

### 1. Device Fingerprinting & Binding

**Purpose**: Prevents account sharing by binding each Bubbler account to a specific device.

**Implementation**:
- **Device Fingerprint Generation**: Creates a unique fingerprint using:
  - Browser user agent
  - Screen resolution and color depth
  - Hardware concurrency and device memory
  - Canvas fingerprinting
  - Timezone and language settings
  - Platform information

- **Secure Storage**: Fingerprints are hashed using SHA-256 before storage
- **Database Structure**: Uses dedicated `device_fingerprints` table with audit trail

### 2. Phone Number Locking

**Purpose**: Prevents users from changing phone numbers, which could be used for account sharing.

**Implementation**:
- Phone number field is read-only for Bubbler users
- Only administrators can update phone numbers
- Clear messaging: "Phone number cannot be changed - contact admin for updates"

### 3. Session Management & Validation

**Purpose**: Ensures only authorized devices can access accounts.

**Implementation**:
- Device validation on every profile save attempt
- Automatic device binding on first profile save
- Session tracking with IP address logging
- Login attempt audit trail

## üìä Database Schema

### Device Fingerprints Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE device_fingerprints (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  bubbler_id UUID REFERENCES bubblers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  fingerprint_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  device_metadata JSONB,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
  last_used TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
  created_by_admin BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  reset_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);
```

### Login History Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE login_history (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  bubbler_id UUID REFERENCES bubblers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  ip_address TEXT,
  device_fingerprint_hash TEXT,
  user_agent TEXT,
  login_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
  login_success BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  failure_reason TEXT,
  session_id TEXT
);
```

## üîß Admin Controls

### Device Management
- **View Device Status**: See which devices are bound to each account
- **Clear Device Binding**: Allow users to bind to new devices
- **Reset Count Tracking**: Monitor how often device bindings are reset
- **Login History**: View audit trail of login attempts

### Security Monitoring
- **Failed Login Attempts**: Track unauthorized access attempts
- **IP Address Logging**: Monitor login locations
- **Device Metadata**: View browser and OS information

## üöÄ User Experience

### For Bubbler Users
1. **First Login**: Device is automatically bound when profile is first saved
2. **Device Locked**: Clear indication that account is secured
3. **Unauthorized Access**: Clear error message if trying to access from different device
4. **Admin Contact**: Clear instructions to contact admin for device transfers

### For Administrators
1. **Device Overview**: See all device bindings in the Bubblers table
2. **Quick Actions**: Clear device binding with one click
3. **Security Alerts**: Monitor for suspicious activity
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of device changes and login attempts

## üîí Security Workflow

### New User Onboarding
1. User completes application and is approved
2. User receives temporary password and onboarding link
3. User logs in and saves profile for first time
4. Device is automatically bound to account
5. User can no longer access account from other devices

### Device Transfer Process
1. User contacts admin requesting device transfer
2. Admin verifies user identity
3. Admin clears device binding from dashboard
4. User can now bind to new device on next login
5. All actions are logged in audit trail

### Unauthorized Access Prevention
1. User attempts to login from different device
2. System validates device fingerprint
3. If fingerprint doesn't match, access is denied
4. Failed attempt is logged with IP address
5. User sees clear message to contact admin

## üìà Monitoring & Analytics

### Security Metrics
- **Device Binding Rate**: Percentage of users with active device binding
- **Reset Frequency**: How often device bindings are cleared
- **Failed Login Attempts**: Track potential security threats
- **Geographic Access**: Monitor login locations for suspicious activity

### Admin Dashboard Features
- **Security Overview**: Summary of device binding status
- **Recent Activity**: Latest login attempts and device changes
- **Alert System**: Notifications for unusual activity
- **Export Capabilities**: Download security logs for analysis

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Frontend Security
- **Device Fingerprinting**: JavaScript-based fingerprint generation
- **Real-time Validation**: Check device binding on every save
- **User Feedback**: Clear messaging about security status
- **Admin Interface**: Comprehensive device management tools

### Backend Security
- **Database Functions**: Server-side validation logic
- **Audit Logging**: Complete trail of all security events
- **Hash Storage**: Secure storage of device fingerprints
- **Session Management**: Track and validate sessions

## üîÑ Migration & Updates

### Database Migration
Run the provided SQL migration script to:
- Add device binding columns to existing tables
- Create new security tables
- Set up audit logging functions
- Add performance indexes

### Backward Compatibility
- Legacy device binding fields maintained for existing users
- Gradual migration to new system
- No disruption to existing functionality

## üö® Security Best Practices

### For Users
- Never share login credentials
- Contact admin immediately if device is lost/stolen
- Use only authorized devices for account access
- Report suspicious activity

### For Administrators
- Verify user identity before clearing device binding
- Monitor login history for unusual patterns
- Regularly review security metrics
- Keep security documentation updated

## üìû Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Device Not Authorized" Error**: Contact admin to clear device binding
2. **Lost Device**: Admin can reset binding after identity verification
3. **Browser Changes**: May require new device binding
4. **Multiple Devices**: Only one device can be bound at a time

### Admin Procedures
1. **Device Reset**: Use admin dashboard to clear binding
2. **User Verification**: Always verify identity before changes
3. **Audit Review**: Check login history for suspicious activity
4. **Documentation**: Keep records of all security changes
