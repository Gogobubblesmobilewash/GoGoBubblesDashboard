## ðŸ’° **Payment System When Assuming Roles**

### **Admin Payment Routing**
When you assume any role and perform work, all payouts are automatically routed to your admin account and marked as internal labor:

- **Payout Destination**: Admin account
- **Labor Classification**: Internal labor
- **Payment Tracking**: All payments logged in admin override logs
- **Tax Treatment**: Internal labor for accounting purposes

### **Full Takeover Payment Examples:**

**Scenario 1: No Show (0% completion)**
```
Job: $45 home cleaning
Original Bubbler: Never showed up
You (Admin as Lead Bubbler): Complete entire job

PAYMENT ROUTING:
â€¢ You get: $45 (full job) + $10 bonus = $55 â†’ Admin account (internal labor)
â€¢ Original bubbler gets: $0 (nothing - no show)
â€¢ Company receives: $10 penalty revenue
â€¢ Net company impact: +$10 penalty - $55 admin labor = -$45
```

**Scenario 2: Abandonment (15% completion)**
```
Job: $45 home cleaning
Original Bubbler: Started but abandoned after 15% completion
You (Admin as Lead Bubbler): Complete remaining 85%

PAYMENT ROUTING:
â€¢ You get: $35 (tier for 1-29%) + $8 bonus = $43 â†’ Admin account (internal labor)
â€¢ Original bubbler gets: $10 ($45 - $35)
â€¢ Company receives: $8 penalty revenue
â€¢ Net company impact: +$8 penalty - $43 admin labor = -$35
```

### **Partial Takeover Payment Examples:**

**Scenario 1: Sparkle Service QA Rework**
```
Job: $45 home cleaning
Original Bubbler: Completed entire job but 2 rooms failed QA
QA Threshold: 2 moderate tasks = Partial takeover triggered
Rework Required: 1.5 hours to fix 2 rooms

PAYMENT ROUTING:
â€¢ You get: $20/hour Ã— 1.5 hours + $15 bonus = $45 â†’ Admin account (internal labor)
â€¢ Original bubbler gets: $45 (full job) - $15 (penalty) = $30
â€¢ Company receives: $15 penalty revenue
â€¢ Net company impact: +$15 penalty - $45 admin labor = -$30
```

**Scenario 2: Fresh Service QA Rework**
```
Job: $45 laundry service
Original Bubbler: Completed entire job but 3 minor issues found
QA Threshold: 3 minor tasks = Partial takeover triggered
Rework Required: 1 hour to fix issues

PAYMENT ROUTING:
â€¢ You get: $17/hour Ã— 1 hour + $10 bonus = $27 â†’ Admin account (internal labor)
â€¢ Original bubbler gets: $45 (full job) - $10 (penalty) = $35
â€¢ Company receives: $10 penalty revenue
â€¢ Net company impact: +$10 penalty - $27 admin labor = -$17
```

### **Light Assistance Payment Examples:**

**Scenario: Quick Assistance**
```
Job: $45 home cleaning
Original Bubbler: Needs 15 minutes of assistance
You (Admin as Lead Bubbler): Provide assistance

PAYMENT ROUTING:
â€¢ You get: $20/hour Ã— 0.25 hours = $5 â†’ Admin account (internal labor)
â€¢ Original bubbler gets: $45 (full job, no penalty)
â€¢ Company receives: $0 penalty revenue
â€¢ Net company impact: $0 penalty - $5 admin labor = -$5
```
