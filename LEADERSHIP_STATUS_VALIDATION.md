# 👥 **LEADERSHIP STATUS VALIDATION**
## Hiding Equipment & Assistance Requests for Inactive Lead Bubblers

---

## 🚨 **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

**Equipment delivery requests and assistance requests were NOT properly hidden when no Lead Bubbler is active.**

### **❌ Previous Problem:**
- Equipment assistance requests showed regardless of Lead Bubbler's `leadership_status`
- Assistance prompts appeared even when Lead Bubbler was suspended or revoked
- No validation of `leadership_status` before displaying oversight features
- Inactive Lead Bubblers could still see and interact with equipment/assistance requests

---

## ✅ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **🛠 IMPLEMENTED: Leadership Status Validation**

**Added comprehensive checks for `leadership_status` before showing equipment and assistance requests:**

#### **1. Dashboard Loading Validation**
```javascript
// Check if lead bubbler is active (not suspended or revoked)
const isLeadActive = leadProfile.leadership_status === 'active';

// Only enter oversight mode if lead is active
if (activeShiftData && isLeadActive) {
  setCurrentMode('oversight');
  // Load oversight data only if active
  await loadOversightData(leadProfile, activeShiftData);
} else {
  setCurrentMode('default');
  
  // Show warning if lead is suspended or revoked
  if (!isLeadActive) {
    toast.warning('Your Lead Bubbler status is currently inactive. Equipment and assistance requests are disabled.');
  }
}
```

#### **2. Equipment Requests UI Validation**
```javascript
{/* Oversight Mode Content */}
{currentMode === 'oversight' && leadBubblerProfile?.leadership_status === 'active' ? (
  <>
    {/* Equipment Assistance Requests */}
    {equipmentRequests.length > 0 && (
      // Only shows if lead is active
    )}
  </>
) : null}
```

#### **3. Smart Prompts Validation**
```javascript
// Check if lead bubbler is active before showing assistance-related prompts
const isLeadActive = context.leadershipStatus === 'active';

// Assistance prompts only show if lead is active
if (assistanceCount > 0 && isLeadActive) {
  prompts.push({
    type: 'assistance',
    message: `${assistanceCount} Bubblers have requested assistance.`,
    priority: 'high',
    trigger: 'assistance_request'
  });
}

// Equipment requests only show if lead is active
if (context.equipmentRequested && isLeadActive) {
  prompts.push({
    type: 'equipment',
    message: 'Equipment flagged as required for job progression.',
    priority: 'medium',
    trigger: 'equipment_request'
  });
}
```

#### **4. Equipment Request Handler Validation**
```javascript
const handleEquipmentRequest = async (requestId, action) => {
  // Check if lead bubbler is active before processing equipment requests
  if (leadBubblerProfile?.leadership_status !== 'active') {
    toast.error('Your Lead Bubbler status is inactive. Cannot process equipment requests.');
    return;
  }
  
  // Process request only if active
  // ... rest of function
};
```

## 🛡️ **LEADERSHIP STATUS VALUES**

### **Database Schema:**
```sql
leadership_status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'active' 
CHECK (leadership_status IN ('active', 'suspended', 'revoked'))
```

### **Status Meanings:**
- **`'active'`** - Lead Bubbler can see and process equipment/assistance requests
- **`'suspended'`** - Lead Bubbler temporarily cannot access oversight features
- **`'revoked'`** - Lead Bubbler permanently cannot access oversight features

---

## 🚨 **FEATURES HIDDEN FOR INACTIVE LEAD BUBBLERS**

### **✅ Equipment Requests Hidden:**
- Equipment assistance request UI
- Equipment request processing
- Equipment delivery acceptance
- Equipment-related smart prompts

### **✅ Assistance Requests Hidden:**
- Assistance request prompts
- Help request notifications
- Manual assistance triggers
- Assistance-related smart prompts

### **✅ Oversight Features Hidden:**
- Zone job oversight
- Team member management
- Training session management
- Feedback ratings display
- Intervention capabilities

### **✅ Still Available:**
- Own job management
- Personal earnings data
- Basic dashboard functionality
- Profile management

## 📱 **USER EXPERIENCE**

### **🛠 IMPLEMENTED: Clear User Feedback**

#### **For Inactive Lead Bubblers:**
- **Warning toast** on dashboard load: "Your Lead Bubbler status is currently inactive. Equipment and assistance requests are disabled."
- **Error message** when attempting equipment requests: "Your Lead Bubbler status is inactive. Cannot process equipment requests."
- **UI elements hidden** - No equipment or assistance request sections visible
- **Mode restriction** - Cannot enter oversight mode

#### **For Active Lead Bubblers:**
- **Full oversight access** - All equipment and assistance features available
- **Normal workflow** - No restrictions on oversight capabilities
- **Complete functionality** - All Lead Bubbler features enabled

---

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **🛠 IMPLEMENTED: Comprehensive Validation**

#### **1. Database Query Enhancement:**
```javascript
// Added leadership_status to profile query
const { data: leadProfile } = await supabase
  .from('bubblers')
  .select('assigned_zone, team_members, role, certified_services, current_status, lead_pay_rate, leadership_status')
  .eq('id', user.id)
  .single();
```

#### **2. Conditional Loading:**
```javascript
// Load oversight data only if lead is active
if (activeShiftData && isLeadActive) {
  await loadOversightData(leadProfile, activeShiftData);
}

// Load oversight tasks only if lead is active
if (isLeadActive) {
  await loadOversightTasks();
}
```

#### **3. UI Conditional Rendering:**
```javascript
// Equipment requests only show in oversight mode AND if lead is active
{currentMode === 'oversight' && leadBubblerProfile?.leadership_status === 'active' ? (
  // Equipment requests UI
) : null}
```

#### **4. Function-Level Validation:**
```javascript
// Equipment request handler validates before processing
if (leadBubblerProfile?.leadership_status !== 'active') {
  toast.error('Your Lead Bubbler status is inactive. Cannot process equipment requests.');
  return;
}
```
