## 🔧 **FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. ✅ CHECK-IN TRIGGER & ORDER-OF-OPERATIONS CORRECTION**

#### **Problem Solved:**
- **Before:** Leads selected bubbler, started check-in, then decided assistance type
- **After:** Assistance/rework recorded as it happens per room, not after

#### **New Workflow:**
```javascript
// Room-by-room evaluation flow
evaluateRoom({
  roomId: "kitchen_123",
  roomName: "Kitchen",
  bubblerId: "bubbler_456",
  leadId: "lead_789",
  evaluationType: "needs_redo", // 'looks_good', 'coaching_only', 'needs_redo'
  notes: "Oven not cleaned properly",
  photos: ["oven_photo1.jpg", "oven_photo2.jpg"],
  assistanceRequested: false
})
```

#### **Implementation:**
- ✅ **Room-based evaluation** - Each room evaluated individually
- ✅ **Real-time logging** - Issues logged as they're discovered
- ✅ **Final submission lockout** - Cannot submit until all rooms evaluated
- ✅ **Proper flow:** Evaluate → Identify → Fix → Document → Coach → Submit

### **2. ✅ ROOM-BASED EVALUATION FLOW**

#### **Problem Solved:**
- **Before:** No clear room-by-room inspection flow
- **After:** Structured room evaluation with tap-to-evaluate logic

#### **New Room Evaluation System:**
```javascript
// Get completed rooms for evaluation
getCompletedRooms({
  jobId: "job_123",
  bubblerId: "bubbler_456",
  serviceType: "home_cleaning"
})
```

#### **Room Evaluation Options:**
| Option | Status | Photo Required | Counts Toward Takeover | Action |
|--------|--------|----------------|------------------------|--------|
| **✅ Looks Good** | GREEN | ❌ No | ❌ No | Auto-log, quick submission |
| **⚠️ Coaching Only** | YELLOW | ❌ No | ❌ No | Optional tag, coaching note |
| **❌ Needs Redo** | RED | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Photo + fix required |

#### **Implementation:**
- ✅ **Completed rooms only** - Can only review rooms marked as completed by bubbler
- ✅ **Tap-to-evaluate** - Simple tap interface for each room
- ✅ **Quick submission** - Green & Yellow can be submitted quickly
- ✅ **Photo requirements** - Only Red status requires photos
- ✅ **Takeover triggers** - 2+ Red issues auto-triggers partial takeover

### **3. ✅ TIMER LOGIC FOR IN-ROUTE MONITORING**

#### **Problem Solved:**
- **Before:** No movement-based pausing for abuse prevention
- **After:** GPS-based movement monitoring with automatic pausing

#### **New In-Route Timer System:**
```javascript
// Start in-route timer
startInRouteTimer({
  leadId: "lead_123",
  bubblerId: "bubbler_456",
  startTime: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  startLocation: { lat: 29.7604, lng: -95.3698 }
})

// Monitor movement
monitorInRouteMovement({
  startTime: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  lastMovementTime: "2024-01-15T10:33:00Z",
  currentLocation: { lat: 29.7604, lng: -95.3698 },
  previousLocation: { lat: 29.7604, lng: -95.3698 }
})
```

#### **Movement Monitoring Logic:**
- ✅ **3-minute no-movement alert** - "We've noticed no movement. Everything OK?"
- ✅ **5-minute auto-pause** - Timer pauses if no response in 2 minutes
- ✅ **Movement detection** - Resumes tracking when motion detected
- ✅ **Time logging** - Total time logged but not paid if paused due to inactivity

### **4. ✅ ASSISTANCE WORKFLOW LOGIC**

#### **Problem Solved:**
- **Before:** Assistance triggers were vague or user-selected
- **After:** Clear assistance workflow with time-based alerts

#### **New Assistance System:**
```javascript
// Start assistance timer
startAssistanceTimer({
  leadId: "lead_123",
  bubblerId: "bubbler_456",
  roomId: "kitchen_123",
  assistanceType: "demonstration" // 'setup', 'demonstration', 'task_completion', 'equipment_delivery'
})

// Monitor assistance duration
monitorAssistanceTimer({
  startTime: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  currentTime: "2024-01-15T10:45:00Z",
  assistanceType: "demonstration"
})
```

#### **Assistance Triggers:**
- ✅ **Bubbler requests help** - Manual assistance request
- ✅ **System flags delay** - Automatic delay detection
- ✅ **Live timer** - Visible assistance timer
- ✅ **15-minute alert** - "You've been assisting for 15 minutes"
- ✅ **30-minute warning** - "Assistance requires justification beyond 30 minutes"
- ✅ **Tagged assistance** - All assistance time tagged and visible on admin logs

### **5. ✅ ASSISTANCE VS REDO VS PARTIAL TAKEOVER CLARITY**

#### **Problem Solved:**
- **Before:** Assistance confused with redo
- **After:** Clear separation of definitions and consequences

#### **Clear Definitions:**

| Type | Definition | Financial Consequence | Trigger |
|------|------------|----------------------|---------|
| **Redo** | Fixing a room previously marked as completed | Auto-logs as red issue | Room marked complete but needs fixing |
| **Assistance** | Helping bubbler on incomplete task | Hourly pay only | Bubbler requests help or system detects delay |
| **Partial Takeover** | 2+ red issues or significant intervention | Bonus from original bubbler | 2+ red issues or >30 min assistance |

#### **Implementation:**
- ✅ **Redo = Red issue** - Automatically counts toward partial takeover
- ✅ **2+ red issues = Partial takeover** - Auto-triggers partial takeover logic
- ✅ **Assistance = Hourly only** - Separate timer, not takeover
- ✅ **Clear consequences** - Rework has financial impact, assistance doesn't

### **6. ✅ PROMPT TRIGGERS (CONFIRMED & IMPLEMENTED)**

#### **All Confirmed Triggers Now Implemented:**

| 🚦 Prompt Type | 🧠 Trigger Logic | ✅ Status |
|----------------|------------------|-----------|
| **Critical** | Job falling behind, 2+ rooms in 5 min, or repeat low ratings | ✅ Implemented |
| **Moderate** | Recently flagged bubbler, due for random QA | ✅ Implemented |
| **Equipment Request** | Equipment flagged as required for job progression | ✅ Implemented |
| **Coaching Reminder** | Yellow status applied = triggers short feedback prompt | ✅ Implemented |
| **Bubbler Needs Help** | Manual help request triggers "Assist Needed" for lead | ✅ Implemented |
| **No Movement Alert** | No GPS movement in 3 minutes while en route | ✅ Implemented |

#### **Enhanced Smart Prompts:**
```javascript
generateSmartPrompts(bubblers, leadId, {
  jobDelay: true,
  delayedRooms: 3,
  repeatLowRatings: true,
  lowRatingCount: 2,
  recentlyFlagged: true,
  equipmentRequested: true,
  yellowStatusApplied: true,
  bubblerNeedsHelp: true,
  noMovement: true,
  movementTime: 5,
  idleTime: 50
})
```

### **7. ✅ UI CORRECTION – SMART ROOM CHECKLIST**

#### **Problem Solved:**
- **Before:** No clear way to navigate rooms with visual clarity
- **After:** Mobile-optimized room checklist with tap-to-review

#### **New Room Interface:**
- ✅ **Completed rooms list** - Shows only rooms marked by bubbler
- ✅ **Tap-to-review behavior** - Simple tap to evaluate each room
- ✅ **Pop-up menu** - Looks Good / Needs Coaching / Redo Needed
- ✅ **Optional tags and photos** - Quick add functionality
- ✅ **Fast and efficient** - Low fatigue, click-efficient design

## 🧩 **ADDITIONAL FEATURES IMPLEMENTED**

### **✅ Allow "Unselect" or "Reassign" Bubbler**
```javascript
unselectBubbler({
  leadId: "lead_123",
  bubblerId: "bubbler_456",
  reason: "error", // 'error', 'emergency', 'reassignment'
  claimedBubblers: ["bubbler_789"]
})
```
**Why:** Prevents lockouts or wrong oversight cases

### **✅ Auto-flag Extended Time in House**
```javascript
checkExtendedTimeInHouse({
  startTime: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  currentTime: "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z",
  threshold: 25 // minutes
})
```
**Why:** Helps reduce clock-padding

### **✅ Remove Bubbler from Pool After QA**
```javascript
removeBubblerFromPool({
  bubblerId: "bubbler_456",
  reason: "qa_completed", // 'qa_completed', 'assistance_requested', 'equipment_needed'
  availableBubblers: [...]
})
```
**Why:** Prevents unnecessary oversight of low-risk bubblers

### **✅ Voice-to-Text Wrap-up**
```javascript
submitWrapUpWithVoice({
  leadId: "lead_123",
  bubblerId: "bubbler_456",
  notes: "Kitchen needs redo",
  voiceNotes: "Bathroom also needs attention",
  photos: ["photo1.jpg"],
  roomEvaluations: [...],
  assistanceLog: [...],
  wrapUpStartTime: "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z"
})
```
**Why:** Speeds up summary logging
