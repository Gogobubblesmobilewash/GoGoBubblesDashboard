# ✅ **FINALIZED: Lead Bubbler Oversight Model + Bonuses + Evaluation Metrics**

## 🧭 **1. Oversight Coverage Logic (Flexible, Not Fixed Zones)**

**Lead Bubblers are not bound by fixed geographic zones.**

Instead, they are evaluated based on the **specific Bubblers they directly oversee on a given day** — regardless of the neighborhood or distance — within a realistic **45-mile working radius**.

### **Key Principles:**
- ✅ **On each day**, a Lead Bubbler may check in on a different group of Bubblers depending on where jobs are concentrated
- ✅ **Quality scores and job outcomes** of those Bubblers they actually checked in on (via rating submissions and completion review) will impact that Lead's performance score
- ✅ **If a Lead checks in on 5 Bubblers on Monday and 3 different ones on Tuesday**, all 8 Bubblers' job reviews and issue logs for those days will count toward that Lead's accountability metrics
- ✅ **This model supports agile coverage**, promotes fairness, and prevents misuse of a fixed-zone system

---

## 💰 **2. Lead Bubbler Compensation & Bonus Structure**

### **🧑‍🔧 Standard Pay**
- **Hourly rate:** Paid when doing quality checks, coaching, light assistance (≤ 30 min)
- **Partial takeovers:** Hourly + $10–15 bonus (from original Bubbler's payout)
- **Full takeovers:** Bonus + remainder of service payout (hourly paused)

### **🌟 Tiered Bonus Accelerator (Leadership Incentive)**

Earn bonus payouts for consistent, high-quality oversight — without takeovers.

| Tier | Minimum Jobs Oversaw (in period) | Rating Avg | No Takeovers? | Bonus |
|------|----------------------------------|------------|---------------|-------|
| **Tier 1** | 10+ jobs in 1 week | 4.7+ | ✅ | **$25** |
| **Tier 2** | 15+ jobs in 1 week | 4.8+ | ✅ | **$35** |
| **Tier 3** | 20+ jobs in 2 weeks | 4.85+ | ✅ | **$50** |

**🟦 Goal:** Reward coaching, oversight, and quality-building — not just takeovers.

---

## 📊 **3. Lead Bubbler Evaluation Metrics**

Lead Bubblers are evaluated on **two performance areas**:

### **A. Leadership Metrics (Coach & Oversight)**
- ✅ **Average rating from Bubblers overseen** (rolling 7–14 days)
- ✅ **Number of takeovers avoided via coaching**
- ✅ **Quality uplift:** Did job ratings improve after lead intervention?
- ✅ **Weekly job check-in count** (meets target)
- ✅ **Bubbler-to-Lead rating** (360° feedback from team members)

### **B. Personal Job Metrics (Own assignments)**
- ✅ **Maintain average rating ≥ 4.5** over last 10 personal jobs
- ✅ **Max 1 flagged customer complaint** per month
- ✅ **Timeliness:** 90% on-time start or earlier
- ✅ **Completion & follow-through:** No no-shows, ghosting, or "left early" flags

**🧠 Low personal scores can disqualify a Lead, even if oversight is strong.**

---

## 🚩 **4. Warning Thresholds & Demotion Criteria**

Lead Bubblers can lose their role if metrics are repeatedly missed.

| Metric Missed | Strike System | Action |
|---------------|---------------|--------|
| Avg leadership score < 4.4 (2 weeks) | 1 Strike | Warning + Coaching |
| Avg personal job score < 4.3 (10 jobs) | 1 Strike | Internal Performance Review |
| 2+ flagged reviews in 30 days | Immediate | Temporary Suspension |
| Pattern of excessive full takeovers | 1 Strike | Role Review – Are they coaching or replacing? |
| Missed 3+ job check-ins in 2 weeks | 1 Strike | May lose weekly bonus eligibility |
| 2+ low Bubbler ratings (< 3 stars) in 30 days | 1 Strike | Admin review + Coaching/mediation |

**✅ 3 total strikes in any 45-day period = removal from Lead role** (can reapply after 30 days).

---

## 🔄 **5. Bubbler-to-Lead Rating (360° Feedback)**

### **Two-way Accountability:**
Lead Bubblers aren't just supervising — they're also being observed.

**Every Bubbler that receives a check-in or quality review will be prompted to rate their Lead Bubbler privately after the job:**

- ✅ **Was the Lead respectful and professional?**
- ✅ **Did the Lead offer useful feedback?**
- ✅ **Was the Lead fair in their evaluation?**
- ✅ **Did the Lead feel approachable and supportive?**

### **Rating Prompt (shown post-job):**
> **"How was your experience with today's Lead?"**
> (1–5 stars + optional comment)
> - ✅ Friendly and supportive
> - ✅ Gave helpful tips or feedback
> - ✅ Treated me with respect
> - ✅ Fair in their judgment

### **Purpose:**
- **Encourages respectful leadership**, not micromanagement
- **Prevents personality clashes**, ego power-trips, or favoritism
- **Helps surface Leads** who may be "technically strong" but poor communicators or team motivators

### **Impact of Poor Bubbler Ratings:**
- **If a Lead receives 2 or more ratings < 3 stars from Bubblers in 30 days:**
  - 🚨 **Admin review is triggered**
  - 🟡 **Coaching/mediation may be required**
  - ⚠️ **1 Strike added to their profile** if complaints are verified
