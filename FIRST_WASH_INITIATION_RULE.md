# 🚦 **FIRST-WASH INITIATION RULE**
## Smart Oversight for Multi-Pickup Fresh Bubbler Workflows

---

## 🔄 **RECAP OF THE SCENARIO**

**Typical Fresh Bubbler behavior on a multi-pickup day, with all jobs under the 36-hour standard tier:**

| Pickup Time | Location Distance | Option 1 | Option 2 |
|-------------|-------------------|----------|----------|
| **8:00 AM** | 15 miles | Pickup + Wash | Pickup + Hold |
| **12:00 PM** | 8 miles | Pickup + Wash | Pickup + Hold |
| **2:00 PM** | 6 miles | Pickup + Wash | Pickup + Hold |
| **4:30 PM** | 4 miles | Pickup + Wash | Pickup + Hold |
| | | Environment Check possible | ❌ No check possible |

**You're worried that Option 2 (hoard-and-wash-later at home) removes your window for QA oversight — you can't verify that:**
- Laundry is sorted properly
- They're washing in a clean environment
- Pets are not around
- They're not skipping steps or doing all jobs in a rush

---

## ⚠️ **THE RISK**

**If we allow unchecked hoarding → Fresh Bubblers can delay wash until later, perform poor-quality work, and lead bubblers will never catch them mid-process.**

---

## ✅ **GOALS**

**You want to:**
- ✅ **Allow flexibility** (we don't want to micromanage job batching)
- ✅ **Ensure oversight** when laundry is actually being done
- ✅ **Prevent bubblers** from batching at home without transparency

---

## 🔍 **SOLUTION: SMART "FIRST-WASH INITIATION" RULE**

### **🧠 Core Principle:**

**If a bubbler chooses to hoard pickups, they must begin their first wash within X hours of their first pickup, or a lead check becomes mandatory.**

---

## ✅ **RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION**

### **🚦 "Start-by Cutoff" Rule for Standard Jobs:**

**"If your first pickup is before 10:00 AM, you must begin laundering by 3:00 PM unless a lead bubbler checks your wash site."**

| Rule Element | Logic |
|--------------|-------|
| **Start Deadline (5–6 hrs)** | Encourages staggered job flow, not end-of-day rush |
| **Optional delay if lead check occurs** | Gives flexibility, ensures oversight |
| **Auto-flag + Alert** | Triggers if wash hasn't started by deadline |

---

## 🛡️ **ENFORCEMENT LOGIC (SYSTEM + POLICY)**

### **🛠 IMPLEMENTED: `enforceFirstWashInitiationRule()`**

#### **System Triggers:**
- ✅ **Track each bubbler's first pickup timestamp**
- ✅ **If no wash started (status: "in_wash") by first_pickup + 6 hours:**
- ✅ **Flag for Lead Check Required**
- ✅ **Alert admin if no lead is scheduled nearby**
- ✅ **Optional: Lock job from being marked as completed**

---

## 📜 **POLICY LANGUAGE (FRESH BUBBLER SOP)**

**🛠 IMPLEMENTED: Fresh Bubbler Policy**

**"Fresh Bubblers who collect multiple jobs must begin their first wash within 6 hours of their first pickup, unless their site is cleared via a Lead Bubbler check-in. This ensures timely turnaround and maintains GoGoBubbles' sanitation and environment standards. Repeated delays or unapproved batching may result in job reassignment."**

---

## 📦 **WHAT THIS ACHIEVES**

| ✅ Benefit | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| ✅ **Prevents laundry hoarding** | Encourages natural flow or oversight |
| ✅ **Still allows flexibility** | Bubblers can choose laundromat/home |
| ✅ **Enables QA if washing from home** | Lead must check folding/washing area |
| ✅ **Aligns with real-world distances** | No tight micromanaging per pickup |

## ✅ **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **🛠 IMPLEMENTED: `handleFirstPickup()`**

**First pickup detection and 6-hour timer initiation:**
```javascript
const firstWashResult = handleFirstPickup(bubblerId, jobId, timestamp, activeJobs);
```

**Features:**
- **Automatic first pickup detection** - Identifies first job of the day
- **6-hour countdown timer** - Starts immediately on first pickup
- **Timer persistence** - Continues across multiple pickups
- **Clear messaging** - "First pickup of the day. 6-hour first-wash timer started."

### **🛠 IMPLEMENTED: `startFirstWashTimer()`**

**6-hour countdown timer with warning and violation tracking:**
```javascript
const firstWashTimer = startFirstWashTimer(bubblerId, timestamp);
```

**Timer Configuration:**
- **6-hour deadline** from first pickup
- **75% warning threshold** (4.5 hours) for gentle reminders
- **100% violation threshold** (6 hours) for immediate action
- **Warning and violation tracking** to prevent spam
- **Lead check-in integration** for deadline extension

### **🛠 IMPLEMENTED: `handleStartWash()`**

**Wash start with location tracking and validation:**
```javascript
const washResult = handleStartWash(bubblerId, jobId, timestamp, washLocation, gpsCoordinates, firstWashTimer);
```

**Features:**
- **Location validation** - Must specify "home" or "laundromat"
- **GPS coordinate requirement** - Location tracking mandatory
- **Deadline enforcement** - Cannot start if 6-hour timer expired without lead check-in
- **Environmental QA flagging** - Automatic flag for home washing
- **Location logging** - Saves wash location for oversight

### **🛠 IMPLEMENTED: `handleLeadCheckIn()`**

**Lead check-in processing and deadline extension:**
```javascript
const checkInResult = handleLeadCheckIn(bubblerId, leadCheckInId, timestamp, firstWashTimer);
```

**Features:**
- **Lead check-in validation** - Verifies legitimate check-in
- **Deadline extension** - Extends 6-hour timer when lead checks in
- **Oversight tracking** - Records lead involvement for audit
- **Flexibility provision** - Allows natural workflow with oversight

## 🚨 **ALERT SYSTEM**

### **🛠 IMPLEMENTED: `generateFirstWashAlerts()`**

#### **Alert Types:**

1. **🚦 First Wash Warning Alerts**
   - **Trigger:** 75% of 6-hour timer (4.5 hours remaining)
   - **Priority:** Medium
   - **Action:** Gentle reminder to start wash or get lead check-in

2. **🚨 First Wash Violation Alerts**
   - **Trigger:** 6-hour timer expired without lead check-in
   - **Priority:** Critical

3. **🏠 Environmental QA Required Alerts**
   - **Trigger:** Job washing at home without environmental QA
   - **Priority:** High
   - **Action:** Lead must complete environmental checklist

4. **👥 Lead Check Required Alerts**
   - **Trigger:** Wash start attempted after deadline without lead check-in
   - **Priority:** High
