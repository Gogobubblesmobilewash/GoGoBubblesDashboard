## API Integration

### Activity Logging
```javascript
import activityLogger from '../services/activityLogger';

// Initialize with user context
activityLogger.init(userId, isAdmin);

// Log job assignment
await activityLogger.logJobAssigned(
  jobAssignmentId, 
  bubblerId, 
  customerName, 
  serviceType
);

// Log job completion
await activityLogger.logJobCompleted(
  jobAssignmentId, 
  bubblerId, 
  customerName, 
  rating
);

// Log message sent
await activityLogger.logMessageSent(
  jobAssignmentId, 
  fromUserId, 
  toUserId, 
  messageLength
);
```

### Activity Retrieval
```javascript
// Get recent activities
const activities = await activityLogger.getRecentActivities(50, {
  eventType: 'job_completed',
  userId: specificUserId,
  dateFrom: '2024-01-01'
});

// Get activity statistics
const stats = await activityLogger.getActivityStats('24h');
```

### Real-time Subscriptions
```javascript
// Subscribe to new activities
const subscription = supabase
  .channel('activity-feed')
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    {
      event: 'INSERT',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'activity_log'
    },
    () => {
      loadActivities(); // Refresh activities
    }
  )
  .subscribe();
```

## User Experience Flow

### For Admins
1. **Dashboard Overview** - See recent activities on dashboard
2. **Activity Feed** - Comprehensive view of all platform activities
3. **Real-time Notifications** - Get notified of important events
4. **Activity Analytics** - View activity statistics and trends
5. **Filter and Search** - Find specific activities quickly

### For Bubblers
1. **Personal Activities** - View their own activities and related jobs
2. **Job Notifications** - Get notified of job assignments and updates
3. **Message Notifications** - Receive notifications for new messages
4. **Payment Notifications** - Get notified of payments and payouts

## Integration Points

### Jobs Component Integration
- Log job assignments, completions, and status changes
- Show activity indicators in job listings
- Link activities to specific job assignments

### Messages Component Integration
- Log message sending and reading
- Show message activity in activity feed
- Link message activities to conversations

### Dashboard Integration
- Display recent activities on dashboard
- Show activity statistics and trends
- Provide quick access to activity feed

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Indexes
- `event_type` for fast event filtering
- `user_id` and `related_user_id` for user-based queries
- `job_assignment_id` for job-related activities
- `created_at` for chronological sorting
- `priority` for priority-based filtering

### Real-time Efficiency
- Targeted subscriptions by user and event type
- Minimal data transfer
- Optimistic UI updates

### Caching Strategy
- Cache recent activities in memory
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Use background refresh for updates

## Security Considerations

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only view their own activities and related job activities
- Admins can view all activities
- Users can only create activities as themselves
- Notifications are user-specific

### Data Privacy
- IP addresses and user agents are logged for security
- Sensitive data is not stored in activity logs
- Activity retention policies (90 days for activities, 30 days for read notifications)

### Access Control
- Activity logging requires authentication
- Notification access is user-specific
- Admin-only features are properly protected

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios
1. **Database connection failures** - Graceful degradation with retry logic
2. **Real-time disconnections** - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
3. **Permission errors** - Clear error messages and fallback behavior
4. **Data validation errors** - Input validation and error feedback

### User Feedback
- Loading indicators for async operations
- Toast notifications for success/error states
- Graceful degradation for offline scenarios
- Clear error messages for user actions

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Activity analytics dashboard** with charts and trends
- **Custom notification preferences** per user
- **Activity export** in multiple formats (CSV, PDF)
- **Activity templates** for common events
- **Advanced search** with full-text search capabilities
- **Activity scheduling** for future events
- **Activity collaboration** with comments and reactions
- **Mobile push notifications** for critical events

### Technical Improvements
- **Activity encryption** for sensitive data
- **Activity archiving** for long-term storage
- **Performance monitoring** and optimization
- **A/B testing** for UI improvements
- **Accessibility enhancements** for screen readers
- **Internationalization** support for multiple languages

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Activities not loading
- Check user authentication
- Verify RLS policies
- Check network connectivity
- Review browser console for errors

#### Notifications not appearing
- Verify notification triggers are working
- Check notification table permissions
- Ensure real-time subscriptions are active
- Review activity priority settings

#### Real-time not working
- Check Supabase connection
- Verify subscription setup
- Review channel configuration
- Check for JavaScript errors

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'activity:*');
```

### Performance Monitoring
Monitor activity system performance:
```javascript
// Check activity load times
console.time('activityLoad');
await loadActivities();
console.timeEnd('activityLoad');

// Check notification counts
console.log('Unread notifications:', unreadCount);
```
