# Job Checklist System

## Overview

The Job Checklist System provides **granular task tracking** for every job to prevent fraud, ensure accurate compensation, and maintain operational integrity. This system implements **system-enforced tracking** with zero ambiguity, creating a **chain of custody** between bubblers and lead bubblers.

## üéØ What This Achieves

### ‚úÖ **Real-Time Progress Tracking**
- Know exactly what progress a bubbler has made on a job at any time
- System-enforced task completion with timestamps and location data
- Automatic progress calculations and time estimates

### ‚úÖ **Fraud Prevention**
- Partial or full takeover payouts only triggered when truly necessary
- Bubblers and lead bubblers must report matching data
- System flags suspicious behavior automatically

### ‚úÖ **System as Source of Truth**
- No reliance on emotions or trust
- Data-driven decisions based on actual task completion
- Comprehensive audit trail for all actions

## üß© The Problem Solved

### **Before (Current Issues):**
- Lead Bubblers can self-report "partial" or "full" with no forced cross-check
- Original Bubblers not required to show progress granularly
- Admins can't see in real time if a job is truly behind or not
- Opens door for payout stacking, lazy logging, and false claims

### **After (Solution):**
- **Granular Task Tracking:** Every job has predefined checklist based on service type
- **Real-Time Progress:** System shows exact completion percentage and time estimates
- **Cross-Verification:** Lead bubblers can see actual progress before intervening
- **Fraud Detection:** System flags suspicious patterns automatically

## üîÑ Workflow Process

### **Step 1: Job Creation**
1. **Order placed** with service type and room counts
2. **System generates checklist** from templates
3. **Tasks created** with estimated times
4. **Checklist assigned** to bubbler

### **Step 2: Bubbler Task Tracking**
1. **Bubbler opens job** in dashboard
2. **Checklist displayed** with all tasks
3. **Bubbler checks off tasks** as completed
4. **System records** timestamp, location, and completion time
5. **Progress calculated** in real-time

### **Step 3: Lead Bubbler Oversight**
1. **Lead enters oversight mode** for zone
2. **System shows real-time progress** for all jobs
3. **Lead can see**:
   - Completion percentage
   - Time remaining vs. estimated
   - Individual task status
4. **System flags** jobs that need attention

### **Step 4: Intervention Decision**
1. **Lead assesses** actual progress vs. time remaining
2. **System provides data** to support decision
3. **Lead chooses** intervention level:
   - **Light assistance** (no bonus)
   - **Partial takeover** (bonus required)
   - **Full takeover** (full payout)
4. **Lead completes** remaining tasks in checklist

### **Step 5: Verification & Compensation**
1. **System compares** task completion between bubblers
2. **Automatic verification** based on actual work done
3. **Compensation calculated** based on tasks completed
4. **Fraud detection** flags any inconsistencies

## üìä Compensation Logic

### **NEW RULES (Based on Actual Task Completion):**

| Scenario | Lead Gets | Bubbler Gets | Verification |
|----------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Normal check-in** | Hourly only | Full payout | No bonus |
| **Partial takeover** (30-75% tasks) | Hourly + $10-15 bonus | Full payout unless Lead did 50%+ | Checklist confirms scope |
| **Full takeover** (75%+ tasks) | Full job payout, no hourly | $10 standby fee | Checklist confirms scope |

### **System Auto-Calculates:**
- **Percentage of tasks** done by each bubbler
- **Actual time spent** vs. estimated time
- **Efficiency metrics** for performance tracking
- **Fraud indicators** based on patterns

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Fraud Prevention Features

### **Automatic Safeguards:**
- **Duration Validation:** System flags unusually fast completions
- **Pattern Detection:** Identifies repeated partial takeovers
- **Conflict Checking:** Flags when both bubblers claim same task
- **Location Verification:** GPS tracking for task completion
- **Timestamp Analysis:** Detects unrealistic completion times

### **Manual Review Triggers:**
- **Frequent partials:** Same lead bubbler with many partial takeovers
- **Inconsistent data:** Mismatched task completion claims
- **Time anomalies:** Tasks completed faster than physically possible
- **Location mismatches:** Tasks completed outside job location

### **Admin Alerts:**
```
‚ùó "Possible incentive gaming ‚Äî investigate Order #1043"
- Lead Bubbler: 5 partial takeovers this week
- Original Bubbler: Claims 80% complete, Lead claims 60% complete
- Time discrepancy: 30 minutes unaccounted for
```
